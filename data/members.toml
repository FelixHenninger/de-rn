# This file contains the data used to build the members grid. It is built
# following the TOML file format (https://toml.io/en/).
#
# Please start every new member with a [[members]] heading, and include
# a name, the path to their logo (these are located in the /static/logos
# directory), and the information that is shown in the overlay when visitors
# click on the logo.
#
# Please note that the logos must have a transparency layer set (implying
# that they should be saved as PNG or WebP images) for the hover effects
# to work. A white background alone will not result in a pleasing effect.
