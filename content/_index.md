## Mission

To promote quality, value, rigor, reliability, robustness and transparency of research in Germany.

The German Reproducibility Network is a peer-led interdisciplinary consortium that aims at increasing the trustworthyness and usefulness of research by investigating the factors that contribute to robust research. We promote training activities and disseminate best practice, and work with stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts across the sector. GRNâ€™s activities span multiple levels, including researchers, institutions and other stakeholders (e.g., funders and publishers).

GRN is part of an international network of networks working together to improve research quality and reproducibility.
